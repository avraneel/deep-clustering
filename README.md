# Analysis and Implementation of Deep Clustering

The goal of this report was to propose a modified target class membership distribution function for the Deep Embedded Clustering technique by implementing and analyzing the paper titled “Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis”, which proposes the deep embedded clustering technique that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using a Denoising Autoencoder. 
This project was done under the guidance of our mentors Debapriya Roy and Anal Roy Chowdhury.
